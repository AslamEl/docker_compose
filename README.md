## 🚀 Node.js + MongoDB with Docker Compose

This project demonstrates how to containerize a backend API using **Node.js** and **MongoDB** with **Docker Compose**. It runs as a **multi-container application**, where each service (API and database) is isolated but communicates through Docker networking.

### 📦 Technologies Used
- Node.js + Express.js (Backend API)
- MongoDB (Database)
- Docker & Docker Compose (Multi-container orchestration)

### ▶️ How to Run

Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed. Then run:

```bash
docker compose up
